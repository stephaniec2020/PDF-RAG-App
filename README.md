## What Is Retrieval Augmented Generation, or RAG?
Retrieval augmented generation, or RAG, is an architectural approach that can improve the efficacy of large language model (LLM) applications by leveraging custom data. This is done by retrieving data/documents relevant to a question or task and providing them as context for the LLM. RAG has shown success in support chatbots and Q&A systems that need to maintain up-to-date information or access domain-specific knowledge.
